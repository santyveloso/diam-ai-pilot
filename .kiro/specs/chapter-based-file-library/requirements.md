# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chapter-based file library feature transforms the current single-file upload system into a persistent, organized file management system. This enhancement allows teachers to upload and organize multiple course materials by chapter, while providing students with easy access to relevant materials per topic. The feature maintains the existing Q&A functionality while adding professional content organization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to upload multiple PDF files and organize them by chapter, so that students can easily find and access the right materials for each topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher accesses the upload interface THEN the system SHALL provide a chapter selection option alongside file upload
2. WHEN a teacher uploads a PDF THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to a specific chapter or creation of a new chapter
3. WHEN a teacher uploads multiple files THEN the system SHALL maintain all files in persistent storage organized by chapter
4. WHEN a teacher views the file library THEN the system SHALL display all uploaded files grouped by chapter with file names and upload dates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to browse available course materials organized by chapter and switch between files without re-uploading, so that I can quickly access relevant content for my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a file library panel showing available chapters and files
2. WHEN a student clicks on a chapter THEN the system SHALL expand to show all files within that chapter
3. WHEN a student selects a file THEN the system SHALL load that file for Q&A without requiring re-upload
4. WHEN a student switches between files THEN the system SHALL maintain the current question input and allow immediate querying of the new file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see which file I'm currently using for questions, so that I can ensure I'm asking questions about the right material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student selects a file THEN the system SHALL visually indicate which file is currently active
2. WHEN a student asks a question THEN the system SHALL clearly show which file the AI is referencing
3. WHEN no file is selected THEN the system SHALL prompt the student to select a file before allowing questions
4. WHEN a student switches files THEN the system SHALL update the active file indicator immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to manage my uploaded files by editing chapter names and removing files, so that I can keep the library organized and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher views the file library THEN the system SHALL provide options to rename chapters
2. WHEN a teacher selects a file THEN the system SHALL provide an option to delete that file
3. WHEN a teacher deletes a file THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage and update the library display
4. WHEN a teacher renames a chapter THEN the system SHALL update all files in that chapter to reflect the new name

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the file library to persist across sessions, so that uploaded materials remain available without needing to re-upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher uploads files THEN the system SHALL store them in persistent backend storage
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL reload and display all previously uploaded files
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL maintain all uploaded files (for production, acceptable to lose files in demo/development)
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL show the same shared file library to all users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing Q&A functionality to work seamlessly with the new file selection system, so that no existing features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student asks a question with a file selected THEN the system SHALL process the question using the selected file's content
2. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL maintain the same response quality and format as the current system
3. WHEN a student switches files THEN the system SHALL immediately use the new file for subsequent questions
4. WHEN no file is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent question submission and show appropriate guidance
